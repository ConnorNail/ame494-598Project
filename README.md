# IMU Sensor Package to Detect Accuracy of Virtual Reality Controlled Robotic Arm

This project is designed around a robotic arm system in which a virtual reality headset and controller are used for teleoperated control of a robotic arm. The users arm movements are mimicked by the robot. This projects specifically utilizes an ESP32 and a BNO08x IMU to track the pose of the robotic arms end effector and the userâ€™s hand. This data is then analyzed in order to identify the accuracy of the arm to the users inputs.

## Server Startup Instructions
1. Navigate to t-watch-bno085-main -> aggregator-server
2. Install necessary node dependencies
```npm install```
3. Launch the server
```node server.js```

## Additional Information
This project also contains the necessary files to run on the client ESP32. This file can be found under t-watch-bno085-main -> pod_mcu_code-08x-wifi.

The server will try and stre values in a locally hosted MongoDB at the default port of 27017.
